# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ken Ronoh (Cody)

Iâ€™m a passionate developer and lifelong learner driven by curiosity and creativity. I'm here to learn, build, and collaborate with this incredible global open-source and tech community. My interests lie in blending software with hardware â€” especially in areas like embedded systems, cross-platform development, and cloud-based solutions.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with multiple programming languages, including Visual Basic, C++, Java, Python, R, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, and scripting technologies such as Node.js. Iâ€™ve also worked with a variety of frameworks, including Ionic, CodeIgniter 4, and Laravel. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into Flutter to expand my skills in cross-platform mobile development.

My passion extends beyond code. I enjoy working with robotics, CAD design, Fusion 360, CNC machines, and 3D printing. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how physical product design and automation can come together to solve real-world problems in innovative ways.

Outside of development, I actively participate in hackathons and serve as a STEAM and IB educator. I believe in sharing knowledge and collaborating with others who are just as enthusiastic about tech and education as I am.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or chat about any of the above. You can contact me at **kennethronoh1@gmail.com** â€” Iâ€™m always open to connecting with like-minded creators and learners.
